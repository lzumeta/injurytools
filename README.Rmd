## Overview

**`injurytools`** is a package designed for the field of Sports Medicine. It 
simplifies the data analysis workflow by providing convenience functions and 
handy tools for sports injury data. 

The functions can be classified into: (a) sports injury data preparation, 
(b) descriptive analyses and (c) data visualization routines. Further analyses, 
such as the estimation of the risk of injury with other covariate effects, can 
be performed outside of **`injurytools`**, whether the event of injury 
is viewed as count or time-to-event data.

To get an overview of the package, see the [Articles](https://lzumeta.github.io/injurytools/articles/) section.

In practice, the package can automate specific descriptive reports that are
routinely generated for sports injury surveillance.

## Installation

To install from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org):

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("injurytools")
```

To install the most current version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("lzumeta/injurytools")
```


## Usage

Most functions contain or start with `inj*()` which stands for **injury**.
Functions for data preparation start with `prepare_*()`; and those for data
visualization with `gg_inj*()`.

The below outlines at a glance how **`injurytools`** can help to get a 
comprehensive picture of injury data:

```{r, fig.width = 14.5, fig.height = 6.9}
library(injurytools)
library(ggplot2)

gg_injphoto(injd, 
            title   = "Overview of injuries:\nLiverpool FC 1st male team during 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 seasons",
            by_date = "2 month") +
  ## plus some lines of ggplot2 code..
  xlab("Follow-up date") + ylab("Players") + 
  labs(caption = "source: transfermarkt.com") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5, size = 22),
        axis.text.x.bottom = element_text(size = 13, angle = 20, hjust = 1),
        axis.text.y.left   = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold", vjust = -1),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold", vjust = 1.8),
        legend.text  = element_text(size = 20),
        plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic", size = 12, colour = "gray10"))
```
