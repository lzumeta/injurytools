## Overview

**`injurytools`** is a package aimed at Sports Medicine: it facilitates the data analysis workflow by providing convenience functions and handy tools for sports injury data. 

The functions can be classified into (sports injury) data preparation, descriptive analyses and data visualization routines. Further analyses, such as the estimation of the risk of injury with other covariate effects, can be performed outside of **`injurytools`**, whether the event of injury (outcome variable) is seen as count or
time-to-event data.

To get an overview of the package, see the [Articles](https://lzumeta.github.io/injurytools/articles/) section.

In practice, the package can help automate certain descriptive reports that are routinely made for sports injury surveillance.

## Installation

<!-- To install from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org): -->

<!-- ``` {r} -->
<!-- install.packages("injurytools") -->
<!-- ``` -->

To install the most current version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("lzumeta/injurytools")
```

We are also planning to release the package to
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org). We expect it to be available soon.

## Usage

Most functions contain or start with `inj*()` which stands for **injury**.
Functions for data preparation start with `prepare_*()`; and those for data
visualization with `gg_inj*()`.

Below is a quick look at how **`injurytools`** can help to give a comprehensive
picture of injury data:

```{r, fig.width = 14.5, fig.height = 6.9}
library(injurytools)
library(ggplot2)

gg_injphoto(injd, 
            title   = "Overview of injuries:\nLiverpool FC 1st male team during 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 seasons",
            by_date = "2 month") +
  ## plus some lines of ggplot2 code..
  xlab("Follow-up date") + ylab("Players") + 
  labs(caption = "source: transfermarkt.com") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = 0.5, size = 22),
        axis.text.x.bottom = element_text(size = 13, angle = 20, hjust = 1),
        axis.text.y.left   = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold", vjust = -1),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold", vjust = 1.8),
        legend.text  = element_text(size = 20),
        plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic", size = 12, colour = "gray10"))
```
