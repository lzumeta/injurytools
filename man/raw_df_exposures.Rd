\description{
An example of a player exposure data set that contains minimum required
exposure information as well as other player- and match-related variables. It
includes Liverpool Football Club male's first team players' exposure data,
exposure measured as (number or minutes of) matches played, over two
consecutive seasons, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. Each row refers to
player-season. These data have been scrapped from
\url{https://www.transfermarkt.com/} website using self-defined \strong{R} code
with \code{rvest} and \code{xml2} packages.

This data frame is provided for illustrative purposes. We warn that
they might not be accurate, there might be a mismatch and non-completeness
with what actually occurred. As such, its use cannot be recommended for
epidemiological research (see also Hoenig et al., 2022).
