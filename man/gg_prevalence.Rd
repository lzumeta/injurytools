\title{Plot polar area diagrams representing players' prevalence}
\usage{
gg_prevalence(
  injd,
  time_period = c("monthly", "season"),
  by = NULL,
  line_mean = FALSE,
  title = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{injd}{Prepared data, an \code{injd} object.}

\item{time_period}{Character. One of "monthly" or "season", specifying the
periodicity according to which to calculate the proportions of available
and injured athletes.}

\item{by}{Character specifying the name of the column on the basis of which
to classify the injuries and calculate proportions of the injured athletes.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{line_mean}{TOWRITE!!!}

\item{title}{Text for the main title.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object (to which optionally more layers can be added).
}
\description{
Plot the proportions of available and injured players in the cohort, on a
monthly or season basis, by a polar area diagram. Further information on the
type of injury may be specified so that the injured players proportions are
disaggregated and reported according to this variable.
